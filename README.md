This Readme is a to-do.

**NOTE :** This project has currently not been assigned a license, and is at this moment proprietary. If you have access to that repository, then you probably already have my permission to read, run, study and edit the code, but please do not share it with other people or anywhere outside your personal computer(s) and this private repository.

At some point, I'll update the license of the repository to the [GNU Affero General Public License 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
